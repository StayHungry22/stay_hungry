                <p>
                    French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. <br>
                    They are usually salted and, depending on the country, may be served with ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise, tomato sauce, or other local specialties. Fries can be topped more heavily, as in the dishes of chili cheese fries. Cheese fries or cheesy chips is a dish consisting of French fries covered in cheese, with the possible addition of various other toppings<br>

                        <h2>Procedure</h2>
                        <p>
                            French fries are easy to make at home. But for getting market’s food texture you should know the proper way of making it. Here I show how usually French fries are made in restaurants, and on stalls.<br>
                            <br>
                            Take 4-5 potatoes, Chopped them in fries’ shape. Add them, in fresh water immediately after chopping. Once all potatoes are done with chopping. Wash the chopped fries twice with fresh water. It helps to get extra starch out from potatoes.  Now put 2 Cup of water in deep pan or vessel, add 2 Tbs of salt into it. Then Add chopped fries into water. Let water boils, cook at least 8-10 minutes. This step helps to make fries softer from inside. Don’t overcook the fries. Take them out after 10minutes. Drain water, and put them on cotton cloth, so that they absorb the excess water. Once they get velvety coating from outer side, keep oil in pan for frying. Heat Oil on medium flame, now put Fries in oil. In first step Fry them on medium flame until they turn light golden in colour. Now again fry them in on high flame so it gets crunchy coating on it. If you want to store the French fries, then storer them after First frying batch. Store them in container and refrigerate it. Whenever you want to eat just fry them in heated oil.   <br>
                            <br>
                            Now you can serve homemade French fries with some sauces like ketchup, mayonnaise, or with red chilli sauce. Also, you can grate some cheese on top of it. <br>
