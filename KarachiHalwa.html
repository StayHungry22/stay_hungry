                        <h2>Procedure</h2>
                        <p>
                            It is More like Turkish delight, which made in turkey as sweet dish. In India it is made by using nuts, ghee also called as clarified butter. It comes in various flavours like, rose flavour, elaichi (Basic flavour), and other flours too. Here I made karachi halwa in basic flavour, and I used melon seeds as nuts.<br>
                            First take 1 Cup of corn flour in bowl, add 1 Cup of water into it. Mix well, so there will no lumps in slurry. Make thin slurry of it. Now you can add any food colour into it. So, it will look more attractive and give the feel of market’s halwa. Mix food colour properly. Keep it aside, and put 1 Cup of sugar into pan, along with it add 1 Cup of water to it. Boil until sugar gets melted. Once sugar syrup is ready, add prepared corn colour slurry into it. Now Stir continuously, until it gets stick together. <br>
                            Don’t stop stirring the mixture, otherwise it gets stick to bottom of the pan. Repeate the process for 5-8 minutes then, add melon seeds into it, you can add other nuts like cashews, or finely chopped almonds. Now add 1 Tbs of lemon juice into it. So, it will get tangy and sweet taste. Stir continuously while cooking, add 1-2 Tbs ghee / clarified butter into it. It will get shiny coating on halwa. Once it gets cooked. Switch off the flame. In Total it takes 20 minutes to cook. <br>
                            After that Greece the tray with some ghee and then put halwa mixture into it. Spread evenly with help of spatula. Add extra nuts on it. And keep it aside for 2-3 hours. Once karachi halwa gets set. Take out from tray and cut into square pieces. And your Homemade Bombay karachi Halwa is ready to serve.<br>
