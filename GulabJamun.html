                <h1>Gulab Jamun Recipe | Kala Jamun | Gulab jamun from milk powder</h1>
                <p>
                    Gulab jamun (also spelled gulab jamun) is a milk-solid-based sweet, originating in Medieval Iran, and a type of mithai popular in India, Nepal, Pakistan, the Maldives, etc. It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from khoya, which is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. Modern recipes call for dried or powdered milk instead of khoya. It is often garnished with dried nuts such as almonds and cashews to enhance flavour.<br>
                    There are various types of gulab jamun and every variety has a distinct taste and appearance.   <br>

                        <h2>Procedure</h2>
                        <p>
                            In markets you got various versions, and flavours of gulab jamun. I have shown how to make kala jamun at home, in minimum time. Usually, gulab jamun’s are made from khoya, which is reduced version of milk. Milk is continuously heated and reduced it to a dough. This process takes a lot time, so I used milk powder to make instant khoya.<br>
                            <br>
                            Take a pan put 1/2 Cup milk into it, then add 1 Cup of milk powder. Wisk well so there will be no lumps in mixture. Stir continuously. Within 5 Minutes it starts reducing. Mixture gets reduced to khoya a dough like texture. Now prepare sugar syrup for kala jamun. For this take 1.5 Cups of sugar in saucepan, put 1.5 Cups of water. Add 2-3 Cardamom pods into syrup for taste. Now boil the syrup until sugar gets melt completely.<br>
                            <br>
                            Then take prepared khoya in bowl, add 2 Tbs of plain flour, 1/4 Tbs Baking powder. And knead altogether nicely. Once Dough gets kneaded, take small portions f it, and start making round balls from it. Make sure that balls don’t have any cracks on it. While making balls cover the prepared balls with damn cloth. Now Put some oil or ghee in deep pan for frying the balls. Heat oil on medium flame. Once it gets heated, put the balls in oil one by one. Fry Balls nicely, it will get brown colour first. Cook them at least 4-5 minutes on low flame. So, they get cooked from inside. Once it gets cooked, turn the flame high, and again cook for 30seconds. This process helps to get dark colour on jamun. Take out all prepared jamun in plate And Put them in Sugar syrup. Keep them in sugar syrup for 6-7 hours. So, they can absorb sugar syrup nicely. And kala jamun will turns soft and sweet from inside.<br>
